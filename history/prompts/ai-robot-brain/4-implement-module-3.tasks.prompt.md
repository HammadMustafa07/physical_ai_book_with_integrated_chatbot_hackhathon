```

## Prompt Text
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text
Successfully implemented Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) with all three required chapters:
1. Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim – Perception & Synthetic Data
2. Chapter 2: Isaac ROS – Accelerated Perception & VSLAM
3. Chapter 3: Navigation & Path Planning with Nav2

The implementation includes:
- All three chapter files created with appropriate Docusaurus frontmatter
- Content covering all specified topics from the feature specification
- Proper integration with the Docusaurus navigation system
- Sidebars updated to include the new module after Module 2 (Digital Twin)
- All tasks in the tasks.md file marked as completed [X]

## Outcome
Module 3 has been fully implemented and integrated into the Docusaurus documentation site. The module appears after Module 2 in the navigation structure and contains comprehensive content covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 navigation as specified.

## Evaluation
The implementation successfully fulfills all requirements from the specification with proper educational content, appropriate structure, and correct integration with the existing documentation system.
