# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Glossary

## A

**Action Plan**: A sequence of robotic behaviors generated from natural language, including navigation, perception, and manipulation steps.

**AI Reasoning**: The process by which artificial intelligence systems draw conclusions, make inferences, and solve problems based on available data and knowledge.

## C

**Cognitive Planning**: The process of translating high-level goals into detailed action sequences using AI reasoning and task decomposition.

## I

**Intent Recognition**: The process of identifying the underlying purpose or goal from a spoken command or natural language input.

**LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of artificial intelligence model trained on large amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

## N

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language.

**Navigation**: The ability of a robot to move through an environment from one location to another, often involving path planning and obstacle avoidance.

## P

**Perception**: The ability of a robot to interpret sensory information from its environment, including vision, touch, and other modalities.

**Prompt Engineering**: The practice of designing and refining input prompts to guide the behavior of large language models effectively.

## R

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions for building robot applications.

**Robot Intent**: Structured representation of desired robot behavior derived from natural language commands.

## S

**Speech Recognition**: The technology that enables computers to identify and interpret human voice commands and convert them to text.

**Spatial Reasoning**: The cognitive process of understanding and reasoning about objects in space and their relationships to each other.

## T

**Task Decomposition**: The process of breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks that can be executed sequentially or in parallel.

**Temporal Reasoning**: The ability to understand and reason about time, sequences of events, and causality.

## V

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: An integrated system that connects visual perception, language understanding, and physical action in robotics.

**Voice Command**: A spoken instruction that triggers robotic actions, containing semantic meaning and intent.
